    <!-- Speech Recognition -->
    <h1>Speech Recognition</h1>
    <p>• The SpeechRecognition interface of the Web Speech API is the controller interface for the recognition service;
        this also handles the SpeechRegonitionEvent sent from the recognition service.</p>
    <p>• <i>NOTE :</i> On some browsers, like Chrome, using Speech Recognition on a web page involves a server-based
        recognition engine. Your audio is sent to a web service for recognition processing, so it won't work offline.
    </p>
    <p>• Speech Recognition also inherits properties from its parent interface, EventTarget.</p>

    <p>• <i>SYNTAX :</i> new SpeechRecognition()</p>
    <p>• It does not have any parameters.</p>
